# Junit-Practice

Adding JUnit test cases to at least 5 previous practice problems I have created throughout the Java lessons. Attaching a screenshot of each test case running successfully in my IDE along with the GitHub repo with my code. Each problem needs to be in the repo along with the correct package structure and test cases.
